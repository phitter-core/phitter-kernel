# X - FITTER
This project provides a free and open source alternative to find the probability distribution that best fits a data set. Currently, the project has more than 40 probability distributions and uses the Chi - square, Kolmogorov - Smirnov and Anderson Darling tests. Additionally, each distribution has an Excel file in which it is specified how to generate the inverse function of each distribution from random ones. In the future it will have a web user interface.
